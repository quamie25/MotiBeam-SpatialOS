# Add to git (if you want)
git add EDITING_RULES.md
git commit -m "Add editing protocol for collaborators"
```

**Now whenever Claude Code (or any developer) works on your code:**

"Before you start, read EDITING_RULES.md"

---

## 🎯 SUGGESTED ADDITIONS TO THE RULES

**You might also want to specify:**

### **Directory Structure Rules:**
```
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
--------------------
~/motibeam-spatial-os/
├── spatial_os_pygame.py          [LIVE] Main UI
├── run_pygame.sh                 [LIVE] Launcher script
├── core/
│   ├── notification_banner.py    [LIVE] Header
│   ├── realm_card.py             [LIVE] Card rendering
│   └── ...
├── realms/
│   ├── circlebeam.py             [LIVE] CircleBeam realm
│   ├── marketplace.py            [LIVE] Marketplace realm
│   └── ...
├── ui/
│   ├── animations.py             [LIVE] Animation system
│   └── ...
└── [OLD FILES]
    ├── motibeam_spatial_os.py    [ARCHIVE] Don't touch
    ├── spatial_os.py             [ARCHIVE] Don't touch
    └── ...

RULE: Files in core/, realms/, ui/ are live code.
      Files in root with 'old' names are archives.
```

---

### **Before/After Test Protocol:**
```
BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE:
-------------------------
1. Run: ./run_pygame.sh
2. Take screenshot of current state
3. Note what you're about to change
4. Make the change
5. Run: ./run_pygame.sh
6. Take screenshot of new state
7. Compare: Did your change take effect?
   - YES: Change successful, commit it
   - NO: You edited wrong file, revert and find correct file

This prevents "I made 50 changes and don't know which file is live" situations.
```

## 🎖️ FINAL CHECKLIST FOR CLAUDE CODE

**Send Claude Code this message:**
```
I've created editing rules for MotiBeam Spatial OS. Please read and confirm you understand:

LIVE FILES (Edit Only These):
1. spatial_os_pygame.py - main UI
2. core/notification_banner.py - header

ARCHIVE FILES (Never Touch):
- motibeam_spatial_os.py
- spatial_os.py  
- Any other old versions

VERIFICATION TEST:
Before any edit, change header to "v2" in core/notification_banner.py,
run ./run_pygame.sh, confirm header shows "v2" on projection.

Please confirm:
1. You understand these rules
2. You will only edit spatial_os_pygame.py and core/notification_banner.py
3. You will run the v2 test before making changes
4. You will ask me if unsure which file to edit

Once confirmed, first task: Add 64px emoji to realm cards in spatial_os_pygame.py
